# PanZ

/ˈpanzē/

Yes, PanZ is another pan zoom library. Why? While there are a
bunch of other libraries out there, none of them worked exactly as
I needed.

- No additional dependencies to install
- GPU accelerated transformations through CSS
- Pinch gestures (mobile and trackpad) along with mouse wheel
- Kinetic motion
- Double click to zoom in/out
- Bounds locking
- API for positioning and zooming
- Works with HTML and SVG

## Install

```
npm install @soulfresh/pan-z
```

## Usage

```js
// Make a PanZ instance
const pz = new PanZ();

// Start the pan/zoom functionality on the element specified.
pz.init( someHTMLElement );

// Optionally, you can do things like...
// Center the element within it's parent.
pz.center();

// Listen to the end of pan/zoom gestures.
pz.on('end', ({x, y, scale}) => console.log('position:', x, y, scale));

// When you're done, you should...
pz.destroy();
```

## API

#### `PanZ([options], [element], [fit])`
Create a new PanZ instance.

```js
const pz = new PanZ(options, element);
```

- *__options__ {object}* A config object with the following properties:
  - *__minZoom__ {number|null}* __0.3__<br/>
    The minimum scale allowed. A float as accepted
    by the css `scale()` function. Set this to `null` to turn off
    min zoom bounds clamping.
  - *__maxZoom__ {number|null}* __4__<br/>
    The maximum scale allowed. A float as accepted
    by the css `scale()` function. Set this to `null` to turn off
    max zoom bounds clamping.
  - *__zoomSpeed__ {number}* __1__<br/>
    An integer used to factor the speed of zoom.
    Pass an number greater than 1 to speed up zooming and less
    than 1 to slow it down.
  - *__zoomEnabled__ {boolean}* __true__<br/>
    Set this to false to turn off zoom functionality.
    You can also call `pz.disableZoom()` as needed to do the same.
  - *__panEnabled__ {boolean}* __true__<br/>
    Set this to false to turn off pan functionality.
    You can also call `pz.disablePan()` as needed to do the same.
  - *__bounds__ {number}* __0.8__<br/>
    When 0 = pan and zoom events will not be clamped. Pass a
    number greater than 0 to clamp movement within the bounding element
    rect (as a percentage of the element width/height).
  - *__boundingElement__ {HTMLElement}* __null__<br/>
    The element to use as the bounding client rect for bounds clamping
    (if the bounding option is set). If not specified, the element
    being pan/zoomed will be used as the bounding element.
  - *__initialFit__ {string}* __center|contain|cover__
    The initial position and size of the element.
- *__element__ {HTMLElement}* The element you want to pan/zoom.
  If passed here, pan/zoom functionality will be initialized
  immediately. If you don't construct PanZ with an element,
  then pan/zoom functionality will be initialized once you
  call `pz.init()`.

> __NOTE__ PanZ modifies the `transform-origin` and `transform`
> properties of the HTML element it controls. If you have custom transforms
> you need to apply, you should place them on the parent or child
> of the PanZ element.


#### `PanZ.init(element, [options])`

Initialize (start) the pan/zoom functionality with the given element.
You can call init multiple times with different elenents to change
the element being panned. Doing so will destroy all listeners on
the previous element and then attach listeners to the new element.

If you passed an element in the constructor, then calling
`init` is unnecessary unless you are re-initializing pan/zoom
on a different element.

```js
const pz = new PanZ();

// You can pass options either through the constructor or to init.
pz.init(element, options);
```


- *__element__ {HTMLElement}* The element to pan/zoom.
- *__options__ {object}* The same options object as the constructor.


#### `PanZ.destroy()`
Remove all listeners from the attached element. If needed, you
can reuse a destroyed PanZ instance by calling `init` again.


#### `PanZ.position`
You can get the current pan position and zoom level of the element
at any time, using the `position` property. It returns an object
with x/y/z properties (z = scale).


#### `PanZ.disable()`
Disable pan/zoom on the configured element.


#### `PanZ.enable()`
Re-enable pan/zoom on the configured element.


#### `PanZ.disablePan()`
Disable pan functionality but keep zoom functionality active.


#### `PanZ.enablePan()`
Re-enable pan functionality.


#### `PanZ.disableZoom()`
Disable zoom functionality but keep pan functionality active.


#### `PanZ.enableZoom()`
Re-enable zoom functionality.


#### `PanZ.enabled`
Whether or not either panning or zooming is enabled.


#### `PanZ.panEnabled`
Whether panning is enabled.


#### `PanZ.zoomEnabled`
Whether zooming is enabled.


#### `PanZ.on(event, callback)`
Listen to one of the following events:

- __start__ Called when a pan or zoom gesture begins.
- __update__ Called on each update of a pan or zoom gesture.
- __end__ Called when a pan or zoom gesture ends.

All events are called with the following parameters:
- *__x__ {number}* The x translation of the element
- *__y__ {number}* The y translation of the element
- *__scale__ {number}* The scale of the element
- *__width__ {number}* The __scaled__ width of the element
- *__height__ {number}* The __scaled__ height of the element
- *__unscaledWidth__ {number}* The __unscaled__ width of the element
- *__unscaledHeight__ {number}* The __unscaled__ height of the element


#### `PanZ.off(event, callback)`
Remove a previously registered event listener. Calling the destroy
method, will remove your listeners for you.


#### `PanZ.removeAllListeners()`
Remove all of your listeners from all events. Calling the destroy
method will do this for you automatically.


#### `PanZ.reset()`
Reset the element to its original position (ie. `transform(0, 0) scale(1)`).


#### `PanZ.center()`
Center the element within the `boundingElement` without changing the zoom level.


#### `PanZ.cover()`
Similar to [CSS object-fit: cover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit),
it will size and center the element so it fully covers the bounding element.


#### `PanZ.contain()`
Similar to [CSS object-fit: contain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit),
it will size and center the element so it takes as much space as possible
without clipping.


#### `PanZ.scaleDown()`
Similar to [CSS object-fit: contain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/object-fit),
it will size and center the element so it takes as much space as possible
without clipping and without setting a scale value larger than 1.


#### `PanZ.getContainSize([element], [boundingElement])`
Get the dimensions that are necessary to contain element within boundingElement.
This method is exposed as a convenience and can be used for things such as determining
a good `minZoom` value based on the natural dimensions of the element.

- *__element__ {HTMLElement}* The element to contain within `boundingElement`.
  If not passed, then the element that was used to initialize PanZ is used (this
  will only work if PanZ has been initialized).
- *__boundingElement__ {HTMLElement}* The bounding element to contain `element`.
  If not passed, then the bounding element used to initialize PanZ or the element
  itself is used. This only works if PanZ has already been initialized.

Returns:
- *__dimensions__ {object}* The dimension to contain element withing boundingElement.
  - *__scale__ {number}* The scale value that would contain element.
  - *__width__ {number}* The width value that would contain element.
  - *__height__ {number}* The height value that would contain element.
  - *__x__ {number}* The x position that would center the element.
  - *__y__ {number}* The y position that would center the element.

```js
const pz = new PanZ();

// Determine the scale used to contain element within bounds
const {scale} = pz.getContainSize(element, element.parentNode);

// Initialize PanZ with a `minZoom` equal to the contain size
pz.init(element, {
  minZoom: scale,
  boundingElement: element.parentNode,
});
```

#### `PanZ.getCoverSize([element], [boundingElement])`
Similar to `getContainSize` but using `cover` sizing.

#### `PanZ.getScaleDownSize([element], [boundingElement])`
Similar to `getContainSize` but using `scale-down` sizing.

#### `PanZ.panBy(deltaX, deltaY, [clamp])`
Pan the element from it's current position by some number of pixels.

- *__deltaX__ {number}* Horizontal pixels to move by.
- *__deltaY__ {number}* Vertical pixels to move by.
- *__clamp__ {boolean}* Whether or not to honor bounds clamping.


#### `PanZ.zoomBy(deltaScale, centerX, centerY, [clamp])`
Zoom the elment from it's current zoom around a center point.

- *__deltaScale__ {number}* Scale to add/subtract from the current scale. For example,
  `zoomBy(1)` would double the size of the element from it's current scale.
- *__centerX__ {number}* The center x position around which to perform zooming
  as a percentage (0 - 1) of the element width.
- *__centerY__ {number}* The center y position around which to perform zooming
  as a percentage (0 - 1) of the element height.
- *__clamp__ {boolean}* Whether or not to honor bounds clamping.


#### `PanZ.centerOn(x, y, [z], [clamp], [animate])`
Center on a specific point while also setting the scale.

- *__x__ {number}* __0.5__
  The x center point of scaling as a percentage of the element being panned.
- *__y__ {number}* __0.5__
  The y center point of scaling as a percentage of the element being panned.
- *__scale__ {number}*
  The new scale to set. This is an absolute scale value so 1 = no scaling
  and 0.5 = half the original size. If not specified, this method works
  the same as `panTo`.
- *__clamp__ {boolean}*
  Whether or not to honor bounds clamping.
- *__animate__ {boolean}*
  Whether or not to animate into the new position.


#### `PanZ.panTo(x, y, [clamp], [animate])`
Pan to a specific point on the element without changing the scale.
The x/y location specified will be
centered within the `boundingElement`. X/Y should be specified as a number
between 0-1 that is the percentage of the dimensions of the element.

- *__x__ {number}* __0.5__
  The x location to center on.
- *__y__ {number}* __0.5__
  The y location to center on.
- *__clamp__ {boolean}* __true__
  Whether or not to honor bounds clamping.
- *__animate__ {boolean}* __true__
  Whether or not to animate into the new position.

```js
// Pan to the center of the element
pz.panTo(0.5, 0.5);

// Pan to the bottom right of the element
pz.panTo(1, 1);
```

#### `PanZ.zoomTo(scale, [x], [y], [clamp])`
Set the scale of the element without changing the panning.

- *__scale__ {number}*
  The new scale to set. This is an absolute scale value so 1 = no scaling
  and 0.5 = half the original size.
- *__x__ {number}* __0.5__
  The x center point of scaling as a percentage of the element.
- *__y__ {number}* __0.5__
  The y center point of scaling as a percentage of the element.
- *__clamp__ {boolean}*
  Whether or not to honor bounds clamping.
- *__animate__ {boolean}*
  Whether or not to animate into the new position.


#### `PanZ.zoomToArea(top, left, bottom, right, [clamp])`
Coming Soon...
